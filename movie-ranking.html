<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Entergalactic </h3>
<p>I love Entergalactic for its animation and the way it blends music, art, and romance. It’s a modern, heartfelt story that reminds me love is still possible when we open up and trust.</p>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>Black Panther is empowering and celebrates African culture through strong, intelligent characters, especially women like Shuri and Okoye. Wakanda’s blend of tradition and innovation inspired me with its message of pride, leadership, and unity.</p>
<h3>Avengers:Infinity War</h3>
<p>I enjoy Infinity War for its intensity, emotional depth, and the way it unites so many heroes. The bold ending left me thinking about sacrifice, teamwork, and fighting for something greater than yourself.</p>
